**How to play**

Use the direction keys to control the direction of movement of blocks.

The _`"New Game"`_ button will reset the game, but the best result remains available.

If the value of the block has reached the number _`2048`_ - you are the winner.

If the entire matrix is filled with blocks, you have not reached the number _`2048`_ and the ability to add block values is not there - you are a loser.

Have a good game!
