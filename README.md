How to play

Use the direction keys to control the direction of movement of blocks.
The "New Game" button will reset the game, but the best result remains available.
If the value of the block has reached the number 2048 - you are the winner.
If the entire matrix is filled with blocks, you have not reached the number 2048 and the ability to add block values is not there - you are a loser.
Have a good game!
